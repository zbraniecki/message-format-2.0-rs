# message-format-2.0-rs
MessageFormat 2.0 Prototype in Rust

This repo collects experiments with Message Format 2.0 data model for the [Message Format 2.0 Work Group](https://github.com/unicode-org/message-format-wg).

Each experiment is kept in a branch against master of this repo, and as we settle on elements of the system we'll push to master.

# Experiments

* [Zibi's](https://github.com/zbraniecki/message-format-2.0-rs/tree/ast) - based on [Fluent](https://github.com/projectfluent/fluent-rs)
